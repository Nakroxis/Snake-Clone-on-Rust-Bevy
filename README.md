As this is my first rust and bevy project, it may not be optimal in terms of beauty, safety and performance. 

How do I compile?
If you haven't used Rust and Cargo before:

  1-Download [RustUp](https://rustup.rs/)
  
  2-follow instructions to download Rust.
  
  3-Download VisualStudio Code and download Rust and Rust analyzer addons. Ignore the warning about conflicting addons.
  
  4-Open the project folder using VisualStudio Code and wait till Cargo and Rust analyzer does its magic on the backgroun. You can check the progress at the bottom.
  
  5-Just click the run button on the main function and it should compile and run.

  Just compile the project the usual way, cargo should take care of everything.
